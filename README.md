# The objective:

The purpose of this project was to recreate a Harry Potter Website using CSS Flexbox and what we had been taught.

The class was given a pdf with a image of how the website should turn out with various intructions.

These were as follows:

* The banner image is a background (applied via CSS).

* The banner background image should take up the whole <body> of the webpage.

* The banner height was 80vh.

* The width was 100%.

* The nav height was 25px. 

* The first section had a suggestion for achieving the structure in html.
This would be 2 ```<div>``` inside a container ```<div>``` - flex was used.

* Repeat

:memo: We were told we would learn how to make it more responsive going forward.
This is something I intend to add once learned.

## My Thoughts:thought_balloon:

This one was tricky, but I knew going in CSS eluded me.  
However after having an extra session with my mentor I was able to see what my problems were.

1.  My Approach:
    
    I was all over the place, making changes to one element and when I couldn't get it to adjust anymore, I would just move onto the next element I fancied trying to style.
My mentor taught me how to change my approach for the better.
    
I needed to take the document from top to bottom and split screen my html document and CSS style sheet.
Starting from the ```<body>``` element, I worked my way down the document, I didn't move onto new elements until I had applied all the styles I could to it.

2. My Focus:
    
   Again I was focused too much on trying to manipulating the containers and I was also forgetting to manipulate the box model for each element
   In short my view was too wide and I needed to narrow it.
Again my mentor was the one who helped me see this and reign my focus back to all of the element I was manipulating e.g, content, padding, margin, border.

Once I was able to do this, I found the task straightforward, with alot less frustration and a more formulaic method. 

I also added the lighthouse report for the site, I'm quite happy with the result.
    
I also look forward to increasing its responsiveness.
